    "   + sort these by number of wizards and start the transformations. That is we start transformations that can be only perfomed by one wizard, to the ones that can be performed by numerous wizards, counting the skills that go from 0 to non-zero. When we finish trying to make each transformation, we can return this count as the answer.\n",
