    "Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Player 1 always moves first, and both players always play optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of the game are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initially there are n towers. Each tower is of height m.\n",
    "2. The players move in alternating turns.\n",
    "3. In each turn, a player can choose a tower of height x and reduce its height to y, where 1<= y < x and y evenly divides x.\n",
    "4. If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the values of n and m, determine which player will win. If the first player wins, return 1. Otherwise, return 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "n=2, m=6\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 towers, each 6 units tall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Player has a choice of two moves:\n",
    "- remove 3 pieces from a tower to leave 3 as 6%3==0\n",
    "- remove 5 pieces to leave 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let Player 1 remove 3. Now the towers are 3 and 6 units tall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Player 2 matches the move. Now the towers are both 3 units tall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Player 1 has only one move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Player 1 removes 2 pieces leaving 1. Towers are 1 and 3 units tall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Player 2 matches again. Towers are both 1 unit tall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Player 1 has no move and loses. Return 1.\n"
