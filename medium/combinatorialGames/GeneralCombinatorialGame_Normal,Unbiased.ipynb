    "Step 1: Label every terminal position as a P-position.\n",

    "It is easy to see that the strategy of moving to P-positions wins. From a P-position, your opponent can move only to an N-position (3). Then you may move back to a P-  kkkposition (2). Eventually the game ends at a terminal position and since this is a P-position, you win (1). Here is a characterization of P-positions and N-positions that is valid for impartial\n",
